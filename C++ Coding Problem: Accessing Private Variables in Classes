/*
-Condition 1: All variables are private
-Condition 2: There is only one variable which is "name"
-Condition 3: No lines of code is to be removed from the main, but there is one additional line of code

Objective: Set the name into the input

Private is when all of the information that is stored inside of a class is only akin to merely itself(no other class or the main can use it)
Public is when the information of a class is able to be accessed throughout the main and other classes

Questions:
-Does inheritance matter? No

The method that is able to able private information of class through the means of public information of that same class is called the setter/getter method
