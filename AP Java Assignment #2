/*
Unit 3: Coding Project

You will implement a method called divisibleBy() that will return a String. It will also take an int as a parameter. Based on the parameter num, the method will have 4 different outputs:

If num is an even number and positive, the method will return "num is an even number and positive"
If num is an odd number and positive, the method will return "num is an odd number and positive"
If num is an even number and negative, the method will return "num is an even number and negative"
If num is an odd number and negative, the method will return "num is an odd number and negative"
If num is 0, the method will return "numis neither positive or negative"
Example:

divisiblyBy(2)

2 is an even number and positive

divisibleBy(-5)

-5 is an odd number and negative

divisibleBy(0)

0 is neither positive or negative

Your code will run against tests to see if it is correct. Once all tests pass, then you have successfully completed this project!

Hints:

It might be best to take an approach of using nested if-else statements
Make sure you match the output exactly since any extra space or letter can cause your code to not pass the tests
