/*
Objective: Add or subtract a certain amount of terms,
Necessary Requirements: Scanner, Vector, and Random packages.
Notes: Random randomly generates numbers that to do this you nextInt()
Thought Process:
Scanner: For the user's amount of terms
Random: For generating the numbers, using modulo(%) to either have a + or a -
Vector: To store and simplify the amount of times you create the questions.
