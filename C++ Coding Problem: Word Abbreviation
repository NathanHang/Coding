/*
An assignment given to me by my teacher. 
It was meant to abbreviate long words(longer than 10 letters):
Into their first letter, number of letters between the first letter and the last letter, then the last letter.
Example: Antidisestablishmentarianism -> a26m; Zenith -> Zenith
ALso, the limit to the amount of inputs was 100.
