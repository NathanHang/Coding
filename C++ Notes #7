//How to use class in C++.

/*
Things to note:
-Values in a class are always private, unless specified to be public like in the code.
-The statement: Rectangle(int width, int height) : width(width), height(height), is a constructor
-A consturctor exist just to be there, that anyone could use at any time, but it simply just exists.
*/
#include <iostream>

class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
    public:
        Rectangle(int width, int height) : width(width), height(height) {
            std::cout << "This is a constructor" << std::endl;
        }
        void solveArea();
};

void Rectangle::solveArea(){
    std::cout << "The area is: " << width*height << std::endl;
}

int main()

    Rectangle recObj(5, 10);
    recObj.solveArea();

    return 0;
