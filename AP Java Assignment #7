/*
Unit 9: Coding Project
For this coding exercise, you will implement the Cat class which is a subclass of the Pet class. You will have to make some changes to the Cat class to ensure it is a proper subclass of Pet. You will have to fill in the constructor for the Cat class and override the makeNoise()Â method from the Pet class so that it returns "Meow" instead of "None".


Example
Constructor: Cat obj = new Cat("Sammy", 5, "Siamese", 41283);
System.out.println(obj.makeNoise());
Output: Meow


Your code will run against tests to see if it is correct. Once all tests pass, then you have successfully completed this project!


Hints: 
-How do we call the superclass's constructor to set its instance variables?
-Right now, there is no relationship between Cat and Pet. What keyword do we use to fix this?
-What do we have to include to properly override a method?

//Cat.java
public class Cat {
    public String catBreed;
    public int id;
    
    public Cat(String name, int age, String catBreed, int id) {
        
    }
    
}
//Pet.java
public class Pet {
    public String name;
    public int age;
    
    public Pet(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public String makeNoise() {
        return "None";
    }
}
