		What is scanner?
		Scanner is a class
		What is s?
		s is an object for the Scanner class.
		It's just a name or it's just a VARIABLE name.
		What is keyword "new"?
		new -> say, it is a christmas time, if you want to eat dinner at ABC restaurant, you would reserve a table.
		-In a same way, "new" reserves memory in the RAM.
		-RAM is a computer component.
		-RAM stands for Random-access memory.
		new is basically reserving a fixed size in the RAM, at a specific location that Java doesn't.
		new cares about pointers and address.
		-main obj is a temporary object.
		-main(); of main obj = new main(); is called a constructor.
		-dont even meed public static void or public void for 
		main(final int x)
		{
		    age = x;
		    System.out.println("HI");
		}
		For new main(); need a return value for the variable age and the unknown value x = 5 to put main(5);
		Because it is a constructor, you don't need public static void or public void.
		C++ knowledge{ (brackets to represent that is about C++)
		- std::cout = System.out.print
		- std::endl = ln
		- * knowing the value through &
		- & is the address in the RAM
		}
		- Java does not have the ability to output memory like C++
